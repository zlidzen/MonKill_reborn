Simply office game

-- Why?
Trying to make a game.
Programming training.


-- What kind of f... is this?
At first you should reminde games like "Heroes M&M", "Disciples", "Newerwinter" and "Falluot".
One of interesting part this games was "fighting".
There was role-playing game.
There was step-by-step (in HMM, Disciples, Fallout).
There was on D&D rules (Newerwinter).
There was micromanaged target (Falluot).
It was fun there!

Ok! Let's mix it!

Yes, I know, something like that already exists. (oldbk.ru, taern.ru)

My answer: So what? "I will make mine own game with dungeons and dragons!" (c)

-- What will we have?
It will be just fight: Hero vs monsters.
Hero (and monster) should be had skills and special ability.

-- What will not we have?
We cannot jumping and cannot robbing caravans... I'm sorry.

-- How will it make?
Base: Windows... and then who knows?
Language: rus/eng.
