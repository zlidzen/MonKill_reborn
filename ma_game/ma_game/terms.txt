Rules of the Game!
For the start game you should pick menu "Game/Start".

You will do action by turns with PC.
Who will start is picked randomly.

Action is "Attack" or "Defence".
When you Attack you may pick only ONE part of body as target (Head or Arms or Legs etc.).
When you Defence you may pick TWO parts of body for example Head and Arms.

Damage and Protect volumes are calculating by following scheme: nDx + P - Damage, nDx + R - Resist.
nDx – it is dice: n - throws count, x – max value on dice (1D6 – usual dice with 6 sides).
P - power, R - resist.
Example: 
Yours Attack = 2d4 and Power = 3, then minimal damage value (d.v.) will be:
(2*1) + 3 = 5
Max d.v.:
(2*4) + 3 = 11.
Protect value (p.v.) is calculating as d.v.

When we have attack to not protected part of body, d.v. will be fully counted. 
When we have attack to protected part of body, p.v. will be substracted from d.v.
Example:
There is your turn. You are attacking to Monsters Head on 12 d.v.
Monster is protecting his Head and Arms on 7 p.v.
There is demage which you will make: 12 - 7 = 5 d.v.

You will get experience after each killed monster. You get more experience if you kill higt-level monster.
When you get next level, caracteristics yuor personage will grown.
